This Repo contains everything for DSA. This includes Data Structures and Algorithms and several problems in several languages.

Things considered in the problems:
1. All the problems are first solved in the Naive approach. If Naive approach passes the tests and is 100% successful, then we go to the next problem.
    * We consider that if the problem is 100% successful with the current approach then the other approaches can be taken up later when required. But we have to capture the other approaches somewhere else to refer later.
    * So, If we have ideas to optimise the problems then we add the ideas as comments in the solution for later reference.
